# 🐍 Snake Game (Java Swing)

A classic Snake game built using Java and Swing. This project demonstrates core concepts of game development such as real-time rendering, keyboard input handling, collision detection, and simple game loop architecture.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

Control the snake using your keyboard:

- ⬅️ Left Arrow → Move left  
- ➡️ Right Arrow → Move right  
- ⬆️ Up Arrow → Move up  
- ⬇️ Down Arrow → Move down  

### Objective:
- Eat the red apples to grow longer
- Each apple increases your score
- Avoid hitting:
  - The walls
  - Your own body

The game ends when a collision occurs.

---

## ✨ Features

- Real-time movement using Swing Timer
- Grid-based movement system
- Random apple spawning
- Snake growth system after eating food
- Self-collision detection
- Wall collision detection
- Score tracking system
- Game Over screen with final score

---

## 🧠 How the Game Works (Code Overview)

### Game Loop
The game runs using a `javax.swing.Timer` which continuously updates:
- Snake movement
- Collision checks
- Repainting the screen

### Input Handling
Keyboard input is handled using `KeyAdapter`, which listens for arrow key presses and updates the snake direction.

### Movement System
The snake body is stored in arrays (`x[]` and `y[]`), where each segment follows the previous one.

### Collision System
The game checks:
- If the head touches the body → Game Over
- If the head touches walls → Game Over
- If the head touches apple → Grow + increase score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (GUI)
- AWT (Graphics rendering)
- Timer (game loop)
- KeyListener (input system)
